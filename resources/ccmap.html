                Every child deserves the love of a healthy family. But children who have been orphaned or abandoned are often alone, separated from siblings, and left to fend for themselves in orphanages or on the street. Selamta recreates and empowers families so these children can grow up knowing their God-given dignity and worth, healing generational brokenness, and transforming lives. Selamta’s holistic, community-integrated, permanent approach brings children from institutions and the street into the loving arms of a healthy family where hope and healing are found.

Forever homes are made up of one mom, an “auntie”, and eight previously homeless or abandoned children. In 2023, Central took a team over to Ethiopia to host an English camp for the Selamta children, as well as children from the surrounding community. This provided the children with the opportunity to be immersed in the English language and converse with native speakers, as well as learn five Bible stories.

                The Emmanual Disability Association and Workshop located in Soddo, Ethiopia is often the only option.  Melese Eyob, a founder of the association and workshop makes dreams a reality for disabled Ethiopians. 
                <br><br>
                Melese knows these struggles firsthand.  He has had Polio since childhood and lived on the streets himself, until he was helped by Soddo Christian Hospital 15 years ago with surgery. Even with the surgery, he cannot get around without crutches. He started the association and workshop due to the dire need of medical supplies and job opportunities for the disabled.  The workshop not only improves the lives of those they serve, but also those that they employ. Most of the employees are disabled, many of whom were living on the street before being offered shelter, training, and a job by Melese. He and his team work tirelessly with the minimal supplies available to them.

                Adams Thermal Foundation operates two K-12 schools for at-risk children in southwest Ethiopia. These schools also administer self-help programs so that women and mothers of students can learn business and job skills. Together, these programs seek to break the generational cycle of poverty and lift children and their families out of despair and hopelessness.
                <br><br>
                Adams Thermal Academy Hosanna (ATAH) operates in a city located 115 miles southwest of the capital, Addis Ababa. The school only enrolls students who would otherwise be unable to obtain an education, due to poverty, disease, or the loss of one or both parents. ATAH is one of the top performing schools in the region and serves as an example for other public and private schools there. ATAH also operates a full-day academic schedule, while public schools typically offer only half-day opportunities.

EMI is a Christian non-profit made up of architects, engineers, surveyors, and construction managers who value Design, Discipleship, and Diversity. EMI’s worldwide mission is to develop people, design structures, and construct facilities which serve communities and the Church—facilities like hospitals, schools, water systems, and more. Since joining staff in 2020, Shayla has had the privilege of serving ministries such as CURE Children's Hospital of Zimbabwe with a master plan and clean water system, Bongolo Hospital in Gabon with a design for a Maternity Center, and Church of the Holy Spirit in South Africa with the construction of a new Community Center. Shayla started her journey in ministry during a Central Church Youth Group mission trip to Haiti in 2012. God used this experience in a developing country recovering from a major earthquake to reveal to Shayla the transformative power of architecture, and His desire to use her talents to build His Kingdom and restore the world through design.

                Jason Hopkins is one of very few Sign Language Bible Translation Consultants worldwide. His passion is to help sign language translators create translations that communicate God's Word clearly, accurately and naturally in the various sign languages, giving the Deaf the opportunity to see the Bible in their own language.
        <br><br>
        The Hopkins currently work with a team of Deaf Ghanaians to translate the Bible into their sign language. The goal is to produce scriptures that will be used by the Deaf in Ghana for their spiritual growth.
        <br><br>
        Jason’s main roles are exegete and team mentor. Exegeting scriptures for translation requires a wide range of skills that are developed over time with a significant amount of training. A major goal is to help train the team to do as much as possible on their own so they can reach independence. The more skills and abilities they have the more ownership the Deaf community has over the translation work. While doing the exegesis for the project, Jason is also training the team to take over exegesis.

There are 6,500 languages in the world yet the Bible says that every tribe, tongue, and nation will hear the good news… How is this possible? Their goal is to help translate the gospel of Luke, and dub it into the Jesus Film, so that no one has to learn a new language in order to hear about Jesus. It’s illegal to be a Christian in the countries that they work in, so for security reasons, please reach out to Central’s staff to contact this couple.
