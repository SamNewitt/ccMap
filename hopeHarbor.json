"description":"Hope Harbor offers family-style care for teens as they heal from a variety of issues that are unfortunately commonplace for youth today. These include past abuse, trauma, anger, substance use, mental health issues, exploitation, self-harm, suicidal ideation, anxiety, attachment issues, and more. They work with ordinary kids who are healing from extraordinary things; each one a child of God, loved by the Savior.<br><br><i>Central's Involvement: </i>The Kingdom Fund and Elders voted to use Central’s tithes and offerings to help Hope Harbor with innovative staff trainings and ongoing ministry costs in 2023.<br><br><i>How You Can Get Involved: </i>Hope Harbor’s Parker facility is large and is always in need of all kinds of volunteers.
